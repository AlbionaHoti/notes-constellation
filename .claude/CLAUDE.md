# Project Rules

## Git Commits

Follow Conventional Commits strictly:
- Format: `<type>[scope]: <imperative description>`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, build, ci
- Subject: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, ≤72 chars
- Keep commits concise - one line unless context is essential
- Never use vague messages: "fix", "update", "changes", "wip"

## Time

No time estimates. Focus on what needs to be done, not when.
